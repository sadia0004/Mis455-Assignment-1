        Sketching is the foundation of many art forms. Whether you're creating a 
        quick concept or a detailed portrait, mastering the basics of sketching can
         elevate your work. Here are five tips that have helped me improve my sketching skills over time.</p>

    <ol type="1">
   <li><b>Practice Observation :</b>The key to good drawing is keen observation.
     Drawing from real-life objects or people helps you develop your ability to capture
      proportions and angles accurately. Spend time studying what you're drawing before you 
      even put pencil to paper. Notice the subtle details like how light falls on a surface
       or the unique shapes within your subject.</li><br>
   <li><b>Start with Light, Loose Lines:</b>Don't worry about getting everything perfect on your first attempt.
     Begin with loose, light strokes to map out the basic structure of your sketch. This helps you avoid committing 
     too early to any lines that might need adjusting. You can always darken your lines later once you're happy with
      the overall shape.</li><br>
   <li><b>Focus on Proportions:</b>One of the biggest challenges in sketching is maintaining accurate proportions.
     A common trick is to divide your subject into sections or use a grid to keep everything in balance.
      For instance, when sketching a face, remember that the eyes are positioned halfway down the head, 
      and the space between them is approximately the width of one eye.</li><br>
   <li><b>Experiment with Different Pencils:</b>Pencil choice can make a huge difference in the look and feel of your sketch.
     Hard pencils (e.g., H or 2H) are great for light, clean lines, while softer pencils (e.g., B, 2B) are perfect for darker,
      bolder strokes. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different types to achieve the right contrast and shading in your work.</li><br>
   <li><b>Learn from Mistakes:</b>Mistakes are a natural part of the creative process. Don't be afraid of
     them! Instead, use them as learning opportunities. Sketching is about exploration and refinement. 
     If something doesn’t look right, keep reworking it until you're satisfied, and don’t get discouraged by imperfections.
     Keep practicing, and you’ll see improvement over time. Sketching every day, even for a short amount of time, 
    will help build muscle memory and confidence.</li><br>
