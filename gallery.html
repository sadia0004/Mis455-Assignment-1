        <p style="font-size: larger;"><b><i>Digital Art : </i></b>Digital art is created using digital tools like drawing tablets, software(e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Procreate), or graphic design applications. It encompasses a
            wide variety of styles and forms, from realistic paintings to abstract designs and even 3D modeling.
             Digital art allows for extensive creative control and flexibility. Artists can experiment with 
             textures, colors, and styles more easily than with traditional mediums, and it can be used for
              anything from digital painting to animation or game design.</p>
