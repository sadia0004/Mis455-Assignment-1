    <h3><b>“Meet the Artist' Thoughts Behind the Canvas”</b></h3>
    <p><img id="new-id" src="images/treePic.jpg"><br>"Welcome to my world of colors, creativity, and emotion. 
        Each stroke of paint is a reflection of my journey, my experiences, 
        and the beauty I find in everyday life. Explore my latest works, 
        get inspired, and immerse yourself in art that tells a story."</p>

    <p><img id="another-id" src="/images/sketchFlower.jpg"><br>Like a flower spreading its fragrance without effort, kindness radiates and touches everyone around."

        As flowers fill the air with scent, our positive actions influence those near us.</p>

    <p><img class="different-image" src="images/hills.jpg" ><br>Hills stand tall and silent, teaching us the art of patience and the strength of quiet resilience."

        Hills symbolize endurance and the quiet power of nature, encouraging us to be strong and persistent in our own lives.</p>

    <p><img id="id-2" src="images/bearLovePic.jpg"><br> In every smile we cause, every tear we wipe away, and every moment we share, we build a bond 
        that speaks louder than words. Love, in its purest form, is an ongoing gift, continuously given
         without expecting anything in return, because true love is selfless, resilient, and ever-growing 
         so we should shower love on our loved ones.</p>

    <p><img id="id3" src="images/moonlit.jpg"><br> A moonlit night feels magical, as the soft glow bathes the world
         in a serene silver light. The gentle breeze and rustling leaves create a calming symphony. Stars twinkle in 
         the clear sky, adding to the quiet beauty of the moment. Walking under the moonlight, everything feels 
         peaceful and timeless. It's a perfect time for reflection, where nature whispers its secrets to those who 
         listen.
